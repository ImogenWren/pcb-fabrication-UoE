# PCB Production

## Step 1: Driil PCB

1. Insert copper clad board into router
2. Open RoutePro3000
3. Start Project Wizard
4. Follow instructions and assign drills to correct tool size
5. Ensure that board bottommost hole is 10mm from origin in RoutePro3000 software
6. Run CNC


## Print Etch Mask
_Remember, top of PCB goes towards user on printer_
- Use Versaworks
- Bottom layer might need to be mirrored (check)

## Etch
5 - 10 mins in etch tank.

## Clean Mask

## Tinning Solution
10 - 20 mins

## Print Legend
